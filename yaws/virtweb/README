This directory contains a virtual SIP hosting web interface for Yxa.

It was developed in October 2005, and made possible through funding from
II-Stiftelsen (the Internet infrastructure foundation), with resources from
Internetfonden (the Internet fund) from which I (Fredrik Thulin) received
50.000 SEK (about USD $7000) in 2004.

The purpose of Internetfonden is to gain Internet usage in Sweden, which I
have hopefully helped a tiny bit through this code. Stockholm university
has agreed to host (and maintain) a server (paid through the funding), that
runs this code, until further notice.

See http://yxa.sip.su.se/ for more information about that service (in
Swedish only, since the service is aimed at Swedish users).

Usage :

I have set up a site using Apache Forrest, that is served through the Yaws
web server. One of the pages I generate with Forrest is domain/index.html,
which I then rename and modify slightly (using 'sed') when publishing it.

I make domain/index.yaws contain the following code to get Yaws to run the
files in this directory using Apache Forrest for layout :

	<erl>
	out(Args) ->
	    put({yxa_yaws_util, method}, (Args#arg.req)#http_request.method),
	    case yxa_yaws_util:get_var(Args, "virtaction") of
	        {ok, "edit"} ->
	            {yssi, "yssi-edit.yaws"};
	        {ok, "delete"} ->
	            {yssi, "yssi-delete.yaws"};
	        _ ->
	            {yssi, "yssi-index.yaws"}
	    end.
	</erl>

I do the same thing with a Forrest domain/dnscheck.html that is renamed to
dnscheck.yaws and modified to include

	<erl>
	out(Args) ->
	    {yssi, "yssi-dnscheck.yaws"}.
	</erl>
